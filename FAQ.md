# Faba Box Hacking FAQ

## General Questions

### Q: What are the correct NFC tags to use?
A: Please check [compatible NTAG21x tags](./FAQ_TAGS.md)

### Q: Can I 3D print my own Faba-compatible disks?
A: Yes, it's possible to 3D print disks similar to the original Faba ones. These custom-printed disks can work with the Faba Box.

### Q: What size should the custom disks be?
A: Custom disks should be 5cm in diameter to fit with the Faba Box (Mine are make of wood). A good option is also a [45mm coin capsule](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007424083743.html), it has outer diameter of ~49mm and fits on top of the box.

### Q: Is Faba+ supported?
A: Yes, however Faba+ uses a different method to cipher files.
Use the following script to convert the files (Basically .mp3 with a different extensions and a control file):

```
./createFigureFabaPlus.sh <figure_ID (3 digits)> <source_folder>
```
### Q: How can I add the files to Faba+?
A: In order to add your custom mp3 to Faba+, you can not use the USB (The port is for charging only). You have to:

1. Open the Faba+ (screws under the red bottom pins)
2. Remove the MicroSD
3. Read it using a PC/Mac
4. Place the files there.


### Q: Can I rewrite/reprogram Tags on Faba+?
A: No, it seems that FABA+ stores the Serial ID and associate it to the first figure ID you write. [Issue #11](https://github.com/wansors/myfaba-hacks/issues/11)

## Faba Box and App

### Q: What happens if I connect my Faba Box to the official app?
A: Connecting your Faba Box to the official app may result in an update that erases all folders currently stored in the Box's memory. It's recommended to avoid updating if you want to keep your existing content.

### Q: How much storage does the Faba Box have?
A: Both Faba Box and Faba+ come with 8GB Micro-SD card. On the Faba Box it initially contains about 4.5GB of data. After connecting to the app, this is reduced to around 100MB per figure you own and the audio for figures that you don't own is deleted from the box.

### Q: Can I add my own audio files to the Faba Box?
A: Yes, you can add your own audio files to the Faba Box. However, you'll need to follow specific procedures to ensure they're recognized by the system.

## Hacking and Customization

### Q: How do I write a custom code to an NFC tag?
A: You'll need to use an NFC writing tool to copy the code of a character onto a blank NTAG213 tag. Specific instructions may vary depending on the tool you're using - in general, you need to write NDEF text record with value `021905300XXX00`, where `XXX` stands for figure ID (001 to 999). This text needs to end up between sector 7, byte 3 and sector 10 (0x0A) byte 4 on the tag. For example, app _NFC_Tools_ on both iOS and Android writes the chip correctly by just creating single new "text" field with correct value and writing it.

### Q: What should I do if the Faba Box doesn't recognize my custom tag?
A: If the box's light stays steady and doesn't make any noise when you place your custom tag, double-check that you've written the correct code to the tag and that [you're using a compatible NFC tag type](./FAQ_TAGS.md). If the light flashes rapidly, box has no content for the tag with this figure ID.

### Q: How can I decrypt the files from the Faba Box?
A: To decrypt the files:
1. Compile the Java file: `javac MKICipher.java`
2. Run the program with the path to the file you want to decrypt: `java MKICipher ../../K0403_CP01`

### Q: Is it possible to create custom characters for the Faba Box?
A: Yes, it's possible to create custom characters for the Faba Box by programming custom NFC tags. This requires knowledge of the Faba Box's tag recognition system.

### Q: How do I replace one or several Faba tracks with my own?
A: Follow the steps below:
- Find the relevant folder (check the <a href="https://github.com/wansors/myfaba-hacks/blob/main/TAGS.md">Figure ID Registry</a>) and save a backup copy to your computer.
- Copy a track to your computer and <a href="https://github.com/wansors/myfaba-hacks/blob/main/README.md#decipher-file">decipher it</a> (should be faster than working in the Faba box).
- Check the .mp3 file with id3v2 (or a similar program) to verify file name, should be "K0XXXCPYY" where "XXX" is the figure ID and YY is the track number:
    Linux terminal: $ id3v2 --list [FILE]
- Delete the file and copy the replacement file to your folder.
- Change the replacement file name to the old file's name (usually CP01.mp3 etc.).
- Use id3v2 to clear all other ID3 tags and change the ID3 tag for the track's name to the one of the original file:
    Linux terminal: $ id3v2 -a "" -A "" -c "" -g "" -y "" -T "" --song "K0XXXCPYY" [FILE]
- <a href="https://github.com/wansors/myfaba-hacks/blob/main/README.md#cipher-file">Cipher the track</a> and, if need be, change the file name so it follows the original pattern (e.g. removing the ".mp3" from the file name).
- Copy the track to the relevant folder in the Faba box and unmount the box from your computer. It should now work fine!

Note that some of the above steps are superfluous. If you like living dangerously, you can simply change your replacement songs' names to "CP01.mp3", "CP02.mp3" etc, clear all their ID3 tags and change the ID3 titles following the "K0XXXCPYY" pattern, cipher the tracks and then push them to the box. You can add more tracks than the original folder contained, only limited by available space in the box and presumably no more than 99 tracks can be added.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: What should I do if my custom tags aren't working?
A: If your custom tags aren't working:
1. Verify that you're using NTAG213 compatible tags.
2. Double-check that you've correctly written the character code to the tag.
3. Ensure you're placing the tag correctly on the Faba Box.
4. Try using the tag with the official Faba app to see if it's recognized.

If problems persist, you may need to try [a different brand or type of NFC tag]((./FAQ_TAGS.md)).

### Q: How can I reset my Faba Box to factory settings?
A: The process for resetting a Faba Box to factory settings may vary. Generally, it involves a specific button sequence or connecting to the official app. Consult the user manual or contact Faba support for precise instructions.

### Q: What software dependencies do I need to install?
A: To work with the Faba Box and perform various hacking operations, you'll need to install:

1. Java SDK (Software Development Kit): This is required to compile and run the decryption tool.
2. id3v2: This is a command line ID3v2 tag editor. You can install it on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) using: sudo apt-get install id3v2
